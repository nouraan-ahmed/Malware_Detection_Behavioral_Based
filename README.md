# Malware_Detection_Behavioral_Based
    In this assignment we implement a scanner program that detect a certain behavior and block it.
The program that we detect should allocate a 200MB space in the heap and wait for 10 seconds then free it and repeat this behavior forever.


# Helping libraries 
 We used:
1. psutil
